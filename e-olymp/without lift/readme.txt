
Three friends - Andrei, Boris and Vladimir live respectively on a, b and v floors of a multi-storey building. They play sports, so they never use the elevator. Once they needed to urgently meet at one of them at home.
Make a program that would determine the number of the floor on which they will meet, and the time before the meeting would be minimal. Note that the speed of descent down the stairs is 47/31 times higher than the speed of ascent.

Input data
Three positive numbers - the floor numbers a, b, c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 28), where friends live.
Output data
Print the floor number where friends will meet.
