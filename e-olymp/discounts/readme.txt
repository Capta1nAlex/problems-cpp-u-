Visiting a big store before the New Year, you have chosen a lot of gifts for family and friends. You can save a certain amount of money by using two types of New Year's discounts that are in effect in the store:

When you buy three items, you pay for them as you would for the two most expensive items.

If you buy four items, you pay for them as the three most expensive ones.

Thus, you can combine certain products into threes or fours and pay less for them. You need to determine the smallest possible amount of money that will be spent to purchase all gifts. For example, if the prices of the five selected gifts are: 50, 80, 50, 100, 20, then you can buy the first four items separately, get a discount for them, and then buy the remaining gift at its face value. In total the entire purchase would cost 250 units of money, instead of 300.

Write a program that, given the prices of all gifts, finds the minimum amount of money needed to buy them.

Input Data
The first line contains a single integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 10 000). The second line contains N natural numbers - the prices of the presents. The sum of the prices of all presents is less than 10^9. You can combine not only those items that are consecutive in the input data.

Output
Output a single integer - the found minimum amount of money for which you can buy all gifts.
